# Nonlinear Sciences: Master of Science - Special Problem

Project done under the supervision of Dr. Predrag Cvitanovic and Dr. Boris Gutkin as a member of the Center for Nonlinear Science of Georgia Tech.

Includes work and code in relation to scientific article: **Linear Encoding of the Cat Map**

The scripts in this directory are Mathematica notebook and can easily be downloaded. However, since these notebooks do not render on GitHub, I also attached the pdf version of each script for reading convenience.

1) Introduction and Functions: a brief summary of the problem at hand. Includes most user-defined functions used in the two other notebooks to generate the figures
2) Reconstruction of Orbits - Figures for Paper: figures generated for the article. It includes the derivation of the symbolic dynamics and the corresponding trajectories in phase space.
3) Reconstruction of Orbits - Additional Figures: figures that were generated but not used for the article.
